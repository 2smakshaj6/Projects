# Welcome to My Projects

Hi, I'm Akshaj. I'm currently diving deep into cybersecurity, cloud security, and building things that help me learn by doing.

This space is where I keep track of projects I’ve worked on and the ones I’m still exploring. I use it to document what I build, how I approach problems, and what I learn along the way.

## Projects so far

- [Secure Networking & Monitoring (Homelab)](https://github.com/2smakshaj6/Projects/blob/main/homelab.md)  
  A self-hosted setup combining VPN, firewall rules, intrusion detection, and log monitoring. Built using tools like Tailscale, Suricata, and Wazuh.

- [Personal VPN with WireGuard on AWS](https://github.com/2smakshaj6/Projects/blob/main/vpn.md)  
  Set up a private VPN using WireGuard on an EC2 instance to secure traffic on public networks and learn more about networking and system hardening.

More projects are in progress, and I’ll keep updating this as I go.
