# üîπ Secure Networking & Security Monitoring - Homelab 

*A self-hosted, security-hardened networking project leveraging VPN, firewalls, and security monitoring tools for encrypted remote access and network protection.*

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project serves as a **homelab**, focusing on **secure networking, traffic monitoring, and access control** using open-source security tools. The setup includes a **Tailscale-powered VPN exit node**, firewall hardening with **iptables & UFW**, **Suricata for IDS/IPS**, **Wazuh for centralized security monitoring**, and **AdGuard Home for network-wide DNS filtering**.

Additionally, an **old Windows laptop** has been repurposed to act as a **dedicated Wazuh SIEM server and monitoring station**.

### üöÄ Objectives:
- ‚úÖ Implement **a VPN-based secure network using Tailscale**.
- ‚úÖ Deploy **firewall rules (iptables & UFW) for access control**.
- ‚úÖ Monitor **network traffic & detect threats with Suricata IDS/IPS**.
- ‚úÖ Set up **Wazuh SIEM for centralized security analysis**.
- ‚úÖ Utilize an **old Windows laptop** as a **security monitoring dashboard**.
- ‚úÖ **Future-Proofing**: Transition into a **dedicated homelab setup** in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

### üîπ Networking & Security
- **VPN**: Tailscale (Encrypted Remote Access, Exit Node)
- **Firewall**: iptables + UFW (Traffic Filtering, Security Hardening)
- **Intrusion Detection**: Suricata (IDS/IPS, Packet Inspection)
- **SIEM & Monitoring**: Wazuh (Security Log Analysis, Threat Detection)
- **DNS Filtering**: AdGuard Home (Alternative to Pi-hole)

### üîπ OS & Platforms
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04** (Firewall, VPN, IDS)
- **Windows 10** (Repurposed for Wazuh SIEM & Security Monitoring)
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (Tailscale Exit Node, AdGuard Home)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring a Secure VPN Exit Node with Tailscale
- Installed **Tailscale** on a **Raspberry Pi 4**.
- Enabled **Exit Node mode** to allow remote devices to route traffic securely.
- Configured **firewall rules** to restrict unauthorized access.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall Hardening with iptables & UFW
- Enabled **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** for simple rule management.
- Configured **iptables** for fine-tuned packet filtering & access control.
- Implemented **fail2ban** to protect against brute-force attacks.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Suricata for Intrusion Detection & Prevention
- Installed **Suricata IDS/IPS** on the Ubuntu server.
- Configured **WAN & LAN interfaces** for traffic monitoring.
- Applied **Emerging Threats rulesets** to detect malicious activity.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Wazuh SIEM for Security Monitoring
- Installed **Wazuh Agent** on the Ubuntu server.
- Configured **log forwarding** to a **Wazuh SIEM instance**.
- Integrated **Suricata logs** with Wazuh for **correlated threat analysis**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Integrating the Old Windows Laptop for SIEM Monitoring
- Installed **Wazuh Server** on the **Windows 10 laptop**.
- Configured it to **aggregate and visualize security logs** from the Ubuntu server.
- Installed **Grafana & ELK Stack** for **advanced security dashboards**.
- Enabled **remote access via Tailscale** for **secure log analysis**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Network-Wide DNS Filtering with AdGuard Home
- Installed **AdGuard Home** on the Raspberry Pi.
- Configured **custom blocklists** for malware & ad filtering.
- Set **AdGuard as the DNS resolver** for all network devices.
